# Defogging-Images-using-Dark-Channel-Prior
This project reviews image analysis studies aiming at enhancement of images infected with fog and smog and improvement of such images using defogging algorithms. Many times it is possible that the images captured by the satellite are not clear enough due to fog which are sometimes of no use to us. Different image defogging algorithms can help us to overcome this problem which affects the visual system. This is also one of the main reasons contributing to huge number of accidents during extreme cold climates. The developer of this project intend to improve the visual systems of humans while driving their automobiles in extreme cold and foggy conditions.
